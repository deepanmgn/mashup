\chapter{Software used}

The programs were written in Notepad++ and can be run on a compatible web browser. We would recommend Google chrome. The python version used is 2.7.2 which is freely available from the official python website supported by the Python software foundation.

A few python libraries Beautiful Soup and mechanize are used. Their documentations can be accessed in [6] and [5] respectively.

A read me file has been included with further instructions in installing the necessary software for the python files to execute successfully.
